# CPER_parser.py
This python script parses a CPER (Common Platform Error Record) formatted raw data that is contained in an error event log provided by WHEA-Logger.
You can read the CPER documentation at [https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_2_D.pdf](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_2_D.pdf)

# Usage
Simply run the script and copy/paste the raw data you want to read.

# Disclaimer
The developer of this script is an absolute noob. **It is highly likely that this won't work for your data.** Also, the script is pretty much incomplete and is **only capable of parsing a very limited part of the raw data.**
